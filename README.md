Symmetric stream encryption with 'salt'.<br>
'Salt' is constantly generated, which gives good resistance.<br>
Data size doubles in binary mode.<br>
Tripled in text mode.<br>
There is no diagnosis of the wrong password.<br>
The encryption key size is 296 bits ( 45 - 50 letters ) .<br>
Or light key with 45 bits ( 6 - 8 lettters ) .<br>
The PHP version compatible with C.<br>
Password encrypted × password = can serve as a hash function.<br>
Hash ÷ decrypt (password) == password <br>
If the decrypted hash with the password gives this password, then the password is correct.<br>
Double encryption of known data with a password can serve as a signature. <br>
For example Sha1Sum(data) * password * password = Signature <br>
If the signature decrypted twice gives the checksum, then this gives reason to trust the signed data.<br>
Double data decryption can also serve as a signature.<br>
Data ÷ decryption ÷ decryption = signature<br>
The data is decrypted twice and verified with the signature.<br>
